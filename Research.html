                   As frequent basketball players, my partner and I included prior knowledge of the tendencies of the courts. 
                   To further the data we went out and collected data of the basketball courts everyday at all hours of the day. 
                   Since this is being developed now, all we are able to supply for now is the tendencies of Spring. 
                   To see individual responses, we asked a random array of people who were playing basketball at random times of the 
                   day at different parks to take a little survey after explaining our app.
