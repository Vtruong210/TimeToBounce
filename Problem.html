                <p>Currently, many Dublin residents have a passion for sports that they enjoy participating in after school. 
                Our main focus are the basketball lovers of all ages who want to play, but do not have the time. 
                Many students and working adults are unable to play due to time constraints because they do not know whether or not a park is full at a certain hour
                of the day, so they end up staying home to work instead of possibly wasting valuable time going to a full park. 
                There is no way of knowing whether a park is full, but there is a way of knowing the tendencies of a park and 
                whether it is worth going to play basketball at a certain hour of the day or not.
